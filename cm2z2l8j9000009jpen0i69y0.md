In early stage of startup we use Django React in Monolithic architecture to reduce over complexity and make things simple and clean. Since we don't have any CI/CD tools we are forced make some automation in our existing Monolithic architecture to make our job ease.

So I've I have shared mine *.bashrc* commands to make managing Django's monolithic architecture easier in linux server.

## Open .bashrc of your current user

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

## Alias Commands

I recommend using all the commands which were helpful to me in development. I have shared the commands and normal explanation about the usage.

### Collectstatic

To Collectstatic files of Django's files and React files if configured in Monolithic architecture

```bash
alias Collectstatic='python3 manage.py collectstatic'
```

### Createsuperuser

In Dev environment it is essential to create new user again and again. By using this command we can reduce repetition.

```bash
alias Createsuperuser='python3 manage.py createsuperuser'
```

### Migrate

Migration is always a part of new update in Models of Django. So better having an alias is better

```bash
alias Migrate=' python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate'
```

### Activate

Activating the virtual Environment for Django.

```bash
alias Activate='cd ~/project_dir && source ~/project_dir/vEnv/bin/activate && cd ~/project_dir/app'
```

### Shell

Sometimes to manual migration of Data or executing any tasks using python and Django we need Shell command to make the things easier

```bash
alias Shell='python3 manage.py shell_plus'
```

### RestartFrontend

After putting the static build file of React.js in Django's one of the static directory running this command Restarts the frontend.

```bash
alias RestartFrontend='Activate && Collectstatic && sudo  systemctl  restart  nginx && sudo  systemctl  restart  gunicorn'
```

### RestartBackend

RestartBackend gets the latest version Django from Git main branch and Make migrations and collecting static files making Nginx and Gunicorn restart again.

```bash
alias RestartBackend='git fetch && git rebase && Activate && Migrate &&  sudo  systemctl  restart  nginx && sudo  systemctl  restart  gunicorn'
```

And it also essential when scaling it advisable to move to multiple micro services architecture. Until then these commands will be helpful for rapid development in Django and React.js
